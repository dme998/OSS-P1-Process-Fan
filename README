proc_fan:

This program forks and execs provided executables.
Usage: $  ./proc_fan -n <pr_limit> <exe1> <exe2> <exe3> ...

The option -n is required.  

The parameter <pr_limit> is required and has a max of 20.
  Specifies the max number of child process allowed to run at any given time.
  Once the limit is reached, the parent will wait until a child terminates 
  before launching another.

All parameters following <pr_limit> are executables to be launched or files to be read.
  Example usage: 
    $  ./proc_fan -n 3 testsim1 testsim2 testsim3 testsim4
      In the above example, proc_fan will exec 3 processes: testsim1, testsim2, and testsim3.
      Once one of these processes terminates, it will exec testsim4.
  
  You can also read text files that contain separated programs to be run.
  Example usage:
    $  ./proc_fan -n 3 test.dat
    where test.dat looks like this:
      ./testsim1
      ./testsim2
      ./testsim3

    
Limitations:
  -Does not support parameters for exec'd programs.
    For example, $  ./proc_fan -n 5 testsim 4 5
      will not work, because '4' and '5' will be treated as programs.
